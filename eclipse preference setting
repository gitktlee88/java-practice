Q: Ant can't find com.sun.tools.javac.Main

A: What worked for me:

In Eclipse, access the menu: "Window -> Preferences";
Access "Ant -> Runtime", at the tree;
Access the Classpath tab;
Expand the "Global Entries" item;
Inside Global Entries, the path to "tools.jar" was wrong. It was pointing to an older version of Java;
I removed the wrong entry and added the correct one with "Add External Jars" button. It worked
